What is the problem your Startup is solving?
> The problems that we focus to encounter are :
> * The design and selection of the component on the material level that leads to higher manufacturing cost.
> * High operational RPM of the turbine which leads to higher thermal instability and faster decay of the life span of the machine. It also leads to the requirement of equipment and instrumentations of higher capability resulting in a higher cost in apparatus usage.
> * The high maintenance requirement of the system that leads to the demand for more on-site manpower which not only increases the requirement of capital in hiring a workforce that increases the maintenance cost but it also increases the higher risk of fatality over accidents on site.
> * Availability of lower power output option that leads to failure in meeting power requirements of certain low power requiring systems and areas.

How does your startup propose to solve these problem ?
> In the direction of solving these problems, our startup proposes a new alternator design by the usage of cheaper materials that leads to a considerable reduction in manufacturing cost.
> Providing more power output options for reaching power requirement more regions and systems.
> The lower requirement of maintenance of the system which needs less workforce hiring leading to a decrease in capital investment in the workforce and risk of fatality in accidents making the system more safer and cheaper in those aspects.

What is the uniqueness of the product ?
> * Our design provides the ability to use lighter and cheaper materials for the achievement of cheaper manufacturing and lighter construction.
> * The modularity of the design leads to easier transport and on-site assembly.
> * Availability of more power options ranging from 5kW to 50kW helping in reaching the power requirement of more number of bodies in demand.
> * The lower operational RPM increases the thermal stability of the system which only increases the overall life span of the system but also reduces the cost spent over the cooling apparatuses.

Wealth creation and Employement generation.
> If we talk about the wealth creation aspect of our proposal, the usage of our idea in the renewable energy production sector will lead to a huge contribution to the net power generation by the country with more efficiency and less investment into the cost of component manufacturing. The whole idea would help in contributing to annual power generation by country more significance. Both of these points would directly help a lot in the wealth of the country which would also help the company gaining more shares in the market.
> In terms of generating employment, the industrial establishment of the company like creating factories, corporate infrastructures, etc. would create multiple job opportunities for the people by which the company directly contributes to increasing the overall employment.
